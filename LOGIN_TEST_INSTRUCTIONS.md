# Login Test Instructions

## Issue Summary
The login was failing with an "AxiosError" because:
1. The backend server wasn't running
2. The credentials being used were incorrect (unknown password for existing users)

## Solution Implemented
1. Started the backend server successfully
2. Improved error handling in the frontend to provide more descriptive error messages
3. Created a test user with known credentials

## Test Credentials
You can now test the login with these credentials:

- **Email**: testuser@example.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Role**: admin

## How to Test

1. Make sure the backend server is running:
   ```
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the application in your browser

3. Navigate to the login page

4. Enter the test credentials:
   - Email: testuser@example.com
   - Password: password123
   - Role: admin

5. Click "Sign In"

## Error Handling Improvements

The login component now provides more specific error messages:
- Invalid email format
- Password too short
- Incorrect credentials
- Server errors
- Network issues

## For Future Testing

If you need to create additional test users, you can run:
```
cd server
node create-test-user.js
```

This will create a new test user with the credentials:
- Email: testuser@example.com
- Password: password123
