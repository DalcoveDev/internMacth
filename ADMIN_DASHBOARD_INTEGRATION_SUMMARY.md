- Added proper authorization checks for company and admin roles
- Included validation for status values
- Added error handling and success responses

### Frontend Components
- Enhanced existing AdminDashboard component with new tabs and features
- Added new chart components using Recharts library
- Implemented responsive design for all screen sizes
- Added loading states for better user experience
- Integrated toast notifications for user feedback

### Data Visualization
- Added LineChart for user signups trend
- Implemented AreaChart for site traffic analytics
- Created BarChart for internship postings
- Added PieChart for user roles and geographic distribution
- Integrated custom metrics visualization

## Code Structure

### Modified Files
1. `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Enhanced dashboard with new features
2. `server/src/routes/applications.ts` - Added PATCH status update endpoint
3. `src/lib/new-api-client.ts` - Already had the required API functions

### New Interfaces
- `UserStats`, `InternshipStats`, `ApplicationStats` for type safety
- `SystemMetric`, `UserActivity`, `GeographicDistribution` for analytics
- `Notification` for notifications management

## Security Considerations

- Implemented proper input validation for all API endpoints
- Used parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Performance Optimizations
- Implemented data caching strategies
- Added loading states to improve perceived performance
- Optimized chart rendering with virtualization
- Used efficient data fetching patterns with Promise.all

## Testing
- Verified all API endpoints function correctly
- Tested role-based access control
- Confirmed data visualization displays correctly
- Validated error handling and edge cases

## Future Enhancements
1. Add export functionality for analytics data
2. Implement more detailed user activity tracking
3. Add customizable dashboard widgets
4. Include more AI-powered insights
5. Add audit logging for admin actions
6. Implement real-time WebSocket updates
