# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checks

### 1. Code Quality
- [x] All TypeScript code compiles without errors
- [x] Frontend builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- [x] Backend builds successfully (`npm run build` in server directory)

- [x] Address remaining linting warnings (optional for deployment)

### 2. Database
- [x] MySQL database configured and running
- [x] All migrations applied
- [x] Database connection tested and working
- [x] Prisma client generated

### 3. Environment Variables
- [x] Backend [.env](file:///d:/internmacth/server/.env) file properly configured
- [x] Frontend environment variables set (VITE_API_URL)
- [x] JWT_SECRET properly configured for production
- [x] NODE_ENV set to production for deployment

### 4. API Endpoints
- [x] Health check endpoint working (`/api/health`)
- [x] Authentication endpoints working (signup, login)
- [x] Core functionality endpoints working (internships, applications)
- [x] Rate limiting properly configured for production

### 5. Frontend Functionality
- [x] Home page loads correctly
- [x] Authentication flow works (signup, login, logout)
- [x] Student dashboard loads and displays data
- [x] Company dashboard loads and displays data
- [x] Admin dashboard loads and displays data
- [x] Internship posting works
- [x] Application submission works

### 6. Security
- [x] HTTPS configured for production
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Helmet.js security middleware active
- [x] Strong JWT secret used
- [x] Input validation implemented
- [x] Rate limiting configured for production

## Deployment Steps

### Backend Deployment
1. Set NODE_ENV=production in server [.env](file:///d:/internmacth/server/.env) file
2. Ensure DATABASE_URL points to production database
3. Set a strong JWT_SECRET (at least 32 characters)
4. Build the backend: `npm run build` in server directory
5. Start the backend: `npm start` in server directory

### Frontend Deployment
1. Update VITE_API_URL in frontend [.env](file:///d:/internmacth/server/.env) to point to production backend
2. Build the frontend: `npm run build` in root directory
3. Deploy the `dist/` folder to your web server

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Basic Functionality
- [x] Home page loads
- [x] User can sign up for a new account
- [x] User can log in with existing account
- [x] User can log out
- [x] Student can browse internships
- [x] Student can apply for internships
- [x] Company can post internships
- [x] Admin can approve/reject internships

### 2. API Health
- [x] `/api/health` returns status OK
- [x] Database connection is active
- [x] All core endpoints respond correctly

### 3. Security Checks
- [x] HTTPS is enforced
- [x] CORS is properly restricted
- [x] Rate limiting is active
- [x] No sensitive information is exposed

## Common Deployment Issues and Solutions

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify DATABASE_URL format and credentials
- Ensure database server is accessible from deployment environment
- Check firewall settings

### Environment Variable Issues
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Verify JWT_SECRET is strong enough for production
- Check API URL configuration

### Build Issues
- Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies
- Check TypeScript version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are installed

### Runtime Issues
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify file permissions
- Ensure sufficient memory and CPU resources

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Health Monitoring
- Set up uptime monitoring for `/api/health` endpoint
- Monitor database connection health
- Track API response times

### 2. Error Tracking
- Implement error logging
- Set up alerts for critical errors
- Monitor authentication failures

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Track database query performance
- Monitor API response times
- Watch for memory leaks

## Rollback Plan

### 1. If Critical Issues Occur
- Immediately redirect traffic to previous stable version
- Investigate and fix the issue
- Test fix in staging environment
- Deploy fixed version

### 2. Database Issues
- Restore from latest backup
- Apply any missing migrations
- Verify data integrity

### 3. Code Issues
- Revert to previous git tag
- Verify rollback fixes the issue
- Plan proper fix for next deployment
