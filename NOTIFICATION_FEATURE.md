# Company Notification Feature

This document explains the new notification feature that allows companies to send approval/rejection notifications to students directly from their dashboard.

## Feature Overview

The notification system enables companies to:
1. Send approval notifications to students when their applications are accepted
2. Send rejection notifications to students when their applications are declined
3. Customize messages for each notification
4. View notification history and status

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created

1. **SendNotification.tsx** - A new page component that allows companies to compose and send notifications to students
2. **Route Configuration** - Added a new route in App.tsx for the notification page

### Modified Files

1. **CompanyDashboard.tsx** - Added a "Send Notification" button to the applications section
2. **App.tsx** - Added the route for the new notification page

### Key Features

#### Send Notification Page
- Clean, intuitive interface for composing notifications
- Toggle between approval and rejection notification types
- Optional custom message field
- Preview of the notification before sending
- Success/error feedback after sending

#### Integration with Existing Systems
- Uses the existing notification context for consistency
- Integrates with the toast notification system for user feedback
- Maintains the same design language as the rest of the application

## How It Works

1. **Accessing the Feature**
   - Companies navigate to their dashboard
   - Go to the "Applications" tab
   - For each application, there's now a "Send Notification" button

2. **Composing a Notification**
   - Click the "Send Notification" button for a specific application
   - Choose between "Approval" or "Rejection" notification type
   - Optionally add a custom message
   - Preview the notification content
   - Click "Send Notification" to deliver it

3. **Notification Delivery**
   - Notifications are added to the student's notification center
   - Students receive real-time updates (in the mock implementation)
   - Notifications include relevant metadata like application ID

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```
SendNotification.tsx
├── Header with back navigation
├── Application details display
├── Notification type selection (approval/rejection)
├── Custom message input
├── Preview section
└── Send button with loading state
```

### Data Flow
1. User navigates to `/send-notification/:id`
2. Component loads application details (mocked in this implementation)
3. User selects notification type and optionally adds a custom message
4. On submit, notification is added to the notification context
5. User is redirected back to the company dashboard
6. Success message is displayed

### Styling
- Consistent with the existing dashboard design
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Accessible form elements with proper labeling
- Visual feedback for user actions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Connect to actual backend API for persistent notifications
   - Store notification history in database
   - Implement real-time WebSocket notifications

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Notification templates for common messages
   - Bulk notification sending
   - Notification scheduling
   - Read receipts and tracking

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Rich text editor for custom messages
   - Attachment support
   - Notification status tracking
   - Analytics on notification effectiveness

## Testing

The feature has been tested for:
- Proper routing and navigation
- Form validation and error handling
- Responsive design on different screen sizes
- Integration with existing notification system
- User feedback and success messages

## Conclusion

This notification feature enhances the communication between companies and students, providing a direct channel for application status updates. The implementation follows the existing design patterns and integrates seamlessly with the current notification system.
